# Redux based Multi-step registration form.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Note

App was made purely as Redux App project. It has no validation of any form. The only type of validation is `disabled` state of `next` button when not all mandatory fields are fulfilled. The idea was to keep seperate store for the whole app logic (even if it is a small one) and to implement Redux APIs like `combineReducers`, `connect`, `<Provider />` and others.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

To download all dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
